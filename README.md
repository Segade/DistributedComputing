Repository that contains a distributed computing project.

The project consists of a messanger system between the server and multiple concurrent clients coded in Java. The client side has a menu where users select the required option to send, retrieve one or all the messages or finish the program. The server side processes the messages and depending on the header of the message, it performs the right action.

The project uses SSL in order to encrypt the messages. Moreover, threads are used to manage concurrent clients.

A Word document explains the program and contains screenshots that show how the project words.
